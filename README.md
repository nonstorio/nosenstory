# NonStory Discord Bot (original in Python)
> **NonStory** (a.k.a. "Nonsensical Story") is an improvised party game where players answer given short questions, and as result their answers are composed in a brief nonsensical story which is fun to read!

Here we have Discord bot that automates chat gameplay of NonStory.

## Starting bot
First of all, activate Python virtual environment, so it won't affect global installation.
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To run bot use:
```
python main.py
```

Leaving virtual enironment, thus returning to global Python binaries, is possible by typing:
```
deactivate
```
