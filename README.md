# NosenStory API

> **NosenStory** (a.k.a. "Nonsensical Story") is an improvised party game where players answer given short questions, and as result their answers are composed in a brief nonsensical story which is fun to read!

**NS API** is a client-agnostic interface for maintaining NosenStory's game process across multiple chat platforms.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x and pip](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)
  * needed to run Pipenv (not related to Python binaries required for bot)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
  * needed to reserve dependencies on per-project basis
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  * needed to store data and get reliable read/write access to it

## Getting Started

Revise variables in `.env` file (`PSQL_*` for PostgreSQL connection):
```
$ cp .env.example .env && nano .env
```

### PyCharm

Project contains meta files specifc to PyCharm IDE (author thinks that it's more than feasible for working with Python). These include some sort of inspection guideline to prevent code smell.

When prompted, set Pipenv as project interpreter (SDK). It also must install dependencies listed in `Pipfile`.

Run configuration "api" to activate NS API.

### Shell

Use virtual environment for project and install/update dependencies:
```
$ pipenv shell
$ pipenv install
```

Run NS API within virtual environment with one simple command:
```
$ python -m api
```
