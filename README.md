# NonStory Discord Bot (original in Python)

> **NonStory** (a.k.a. "Nonsensical Story") is an improvised party game where players answer given short questions, and as result their answers are composed in a brief nonsensical story which is fun to read!

Here we have Discord bot that automates chat gameplay for NonStory.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x and pip](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)
  * needed to run Pipenv (not related to Python binaries required for bot)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
  * needed to reserve dependencies on per-project basis
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  * needed to store data and get reliable read/write access to it

## Getting Started

Use virtual environment for project and install/update dependencies:
```
$ pipenv shell
$ pipenv install
```

Don't forget to revise variables in `.env` file, that include `BOT_TOKEN`, `POLYGON_CHANNEL_ID`, `PSQL_*` (PostgreSQL connection), etc.:
```
$ cp .env.example .env && nano .env
```
You'll need to have proper connection with database set up to make bot really work.

Run bot within virtual environment with one simple command:
```
$ python .
```
